<h1>GEM Intel: NeoConservatives</h1>

<p>Neo Conservatives can be our boogie men.</p>

<p>Essentially they can be seen with scorn and disgust as they see commmunists.</p>

<p>I consider men such as Ronald Regean to be neocons. Additionally everyone at Fox News is essentially a neocon.</p>

<p>Fascists fit within the neocon framework.</p>

<p>Neocons generally advocate for progressive social programs to be dismanteled. In turn they enjoy privatization.</p>

<p>The ultimate neocon destiny is to establish neofeudalism.</p>

<p>Neofeudalism is an extreme implemetation of capitalism where there are no positive social protections or worker organization and capitalists are free to rampantly abuse and exploit workers like modern feudalistic lords.</p>
