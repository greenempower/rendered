<p>Often times a republican or shitlib will personally insult you when they aren't winning the argument.</p>

<p>This is generally in bad faith. Do not let it cut deep, because it's not worth it.</p>

<p>(Day 1) opponent: Get a life! You are ugly.</p>

<p>(Day 2) you: I have returned and now I am handsom!</p>
<p>(Day 2) opponent: f*** you, you are too short!</p>

<p>This keeps going until you realize that your opponent is acting in bad faith.</p>
