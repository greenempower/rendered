<h1>GEM Brief: Libre, Open Source, Creative Commons</h1>

<p>The libre software movement was led pioneered by Richard Stallman and hi's Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p>With his work, persona and instantiation of the GPL License he has positioned himself at the more radical end of the larger open source movement.</p>
<p>His emphasis is on user freedom which can encroach on the aims of corporations.</p>
<p>But as many have realized he is essentially a rad-lib and a reformer rather than a revolutionary marxist.</p>

<p>Now Open Source and Creative Commons are neoliberal. They strengthen and server capitalism without fighting it in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>They do this by improving efficiency of corporations in the market by implementing a shared commons which is still meant for exploitation by those companies rather than a fair commons by which every individual benefits and contributes without outsized exploitation by capitalist parasites.</p>

<p>I am now using the Peer Production License detailed in the <a href="http://telekommunisten.net/the-telekommunist-manifesto/">The Telekommunist Manifesto</a>.</p>
<p>It is a solid ideological basis but I am unsure of the specific emphasis on cooperatives. And I am pessimistic that this license will realistically be enforced in this current stage of neoliberal extraction.</p>

<p>Generally our ideology needs a deeper material basis, by that I mean economic and military power. China and the global south grows but here in the imperial core we are subject to the brutal fist of the parasites.</p>
