model for parrallel systems relying on larger numbers of smaller CPUs, high-bandwidth connectd, over larger spaces.

instead of a typical cpu with a single expensive low process node cpu and gpu there can be a pc with several RISC based SoCs within modules. and there can be greater quantities of devices on the LAN.

these higher node SoCs are considerably cheaper and emphasis should be on optimizing software to lessen use of expensive resources such as RAM.
