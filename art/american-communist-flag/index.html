We are tired of the status quo and believe that we can and should do better together. Here is our design for the American Communist Flag.">

		<h1>The American Communist Flag</h1>

		<p>Here is a flag for representing your support of communism while claiming your rightful stake in America and your identity as an American communist/socialist.</p>

		<p>The flag is version 1.0. It is essentially a minimum viable product and you can expect further improvement by me and hopefully others (including you :)).</p>

		<p>Please feel free to adapt it.</p>

		<p>The hammer and sickle portion of this design was taken from the logo of <a href="https://www.cpusa.org">Communist Party USA</a>. I found the design <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CPUSA_logo.svg">here</a>.</p>

		<p>The flag is licensed under the following license so please use it how you like as long as you are not doing so in bad faith or being antithetical to leftist values.</p>

		<p>The license of the flag is subject to change if it becomes necessary.</p>
