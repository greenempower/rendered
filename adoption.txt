I think for this effort to further develop is human networking.

Once the two virtual private servers are bought and configured, I can keep state on this site and offer some more services for comrades.

After that I'd like to form a DisCO of some sort.

Create a texting or call group using Spoke for example.

Create a Mastodon or something of that sort like Friendica.

A Voxim or Minetest server can further be used to build community.
