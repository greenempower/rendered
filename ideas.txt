Low latency / bandwidth desktop: design a desktop environment specifically designed streaming across the internet. The graphics can be largely vectorized and sophisticated smart caches of assets and other patterns can be kept on the client and server.

Potentially you could possess several machines across the globe and they will interface with the client so that their desktops are easily switchable or potentially well integrated into each other.

Inter CPU-RAM cache.

Potentially we could build a system with several SRAM modules mounted in between the CPU and the DRAM modules.

So maybe this new SRAM pool will be slow to access than in-built cache, but faster than interfacing with DRAM directly.

a file format that is a synthesis of the gif compact image and animation format and of vector graphics with curves, text, gradients, textures, etc
I'd like to store the portraits and head shots on greenempower.org in this format and use it in the streaming console project so that I can get something that looks nice and that is more compressable and pleasant to work with than a jpeg

a program that generates intelligible audio books from source code so I can study code using T2S (test to speech app) while hiking
---

---
the language suite should include a tool for generating half translated audio books. the tool should take for example a chinese text and output an .epub or .ogg where each original chinese word is pronounced and then the english translation is given
---

---
I should establish a git push cache locally or within GEM's cloud servers so that repos referencing each other can be synchronized without exposing commits to the public. commits can later be manually sync'd with public repos

Saint Lad GEM should act as the (fictional) patron saint of GEM. He should likely have a supporting person maybe a sister.
The rest of the comrades should be cute little animals like this: https://twitter.com/sovietstern/status/1483264307844587521/photo/1

---
a patch tool called eclectic that merges code from different sources with patches and local modificatons so that it handles copyright and attribution
