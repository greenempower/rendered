<blockquote cite="http://www.revaim.org/uploads/booklets/China%20-%20A%20Modern%20Social-Imperialist%20Power.pdf">Along with the development of capitalist production relations in China, there emerged a small private capitalist class. There were 98,000 small private enterprises in China in 1990. Their total investment was 4.5 billion yuan. This private capitalist class was not a part of the government and had no po-
litical power. It earned profits by exploiting workers the old-fashioned way. There are nevertheless conflicts between the autocratic state-capitalist class and the private capitalist class. The latter, in order to achieve a “free market economy” for all and to gain some political momentum, took up the slogan for bourgeois democracy. To achieve this free market economy, it needed a stable legal system, protection from the autocratic government, clear rights on private property, and pluralistic politics. The autocratic governing capitalist class amassed hundreds of billions of yuan in private property. It had full control over government property as a ruling class sanctioned by the Chinese Communist Party. The new ruling class used its political power to gain monopoly over profits and controlled the privileges of the private capitalist class. Hence, the private capitalist class demanded “democracy.” A minority in revisionist China supported this movement. The majority of Dengist leadership opposed this movement and sought to repress it. The consequence was the Tiananmen Square incident. Zhao Ziyang, who played a major role in liberal reforms, was toppled, and the reform process became more cautious"""</blockquote>

<blockquote>Important internal factors, such as the integration and uniqueness of China’s “red” monopoly capital-ist class, played a central role in repressing the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989. These incidents proved that capitalism by its very nature is anti-democratic and oppressive. A capitalist-fascist system of control can only be imposed upon the working class by the repression of popular uprisings, brutal violence, and the use of state power. The single-party state was still useful to Chinese monopoly capitalism, and repression paved the way for its solidification</blockquote>


<blockquote>
The revisionist ruling class continued to depend on oppressing and robbing the worker class, and this only intensified with the development of capitalist production relations in China. This public authoritarian sector changed slowly into a state-monopoly capitalist sector and finally into private monopoly. It was not always compulsory private assets or public assets (the people’s property) that needed to transform into private assets to develop capitalist relations. For in the process of capitalist development, members of the ruling class procured their private assets by the most dishonest means.The most important ways the bourgeoisie used to illicitly procure private assets from public assets (that is, under people’s management) in revisionist China during the 2nd Generation Reforms are as follows:

<ol>
	<li>Buying and selling with monopoly power: According to experts’ statistics, 400 billion yuan per year in profits accrued to the bourgeoisie as a result of exploiting differentials in price, interest and exchange rates.</li>

	<li>Illegal trade with monopoly power: They bought and sold shares in real estate and stocks instead of goods or services. Shares on the stock exchange are akin to speculative investments. They have values many times greater than that which they actually produce. Naturally, land has no value unless it is changed into a commodity, but once it is subject to the transactions of real estate markets, its value can skyrocket into the millions or billions of yuan. In this way, amassing wealth by illicit means and monopoly power is preferable to accumulating through sales and purchases.</li>

	<li>Trade run by monopoly power: The number of private firms in China in 1992 increased to 420,000. This was 88.9% more than the previous year. All the new companies were run by public enterprises, while more than 60% of trade was run through the public sector. The Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) opened luxurious hotels, and factories under PLA management were used to produce refrigerators, pianos, TV sets, passenger aircraft, etc., on a large scale. There were sales offices in Shenzhen for more than 400 factories. The businesses that ran by absolute monopoly power were far more profitable than legitimate, private businesses.</li>

	<li>Foreign investment: The Chinese state helped foreign investors to rob the people. The state monopolists gained super-profits through foreign investment, and foreign investors found many ways and means to avoid taxes, regulations, and trade restrictions. They tried to procure land at cheap rates, or even at no cost utilizing other privileges. To achieve this, they needed friends in the ruling class, and what better way as a foreign investor than to make individual state monopolists the beneficiary of your foreign investment? It just so happened that the top positions in the public sector were in the control of the sons and daughters of famous leaders in CCP. These individuals conspired with American and Japanese banks, and many other multinational corporations. Party, government and public sector enterprises were hand-in-glove relations without any differences among them. Government revenue and wealth was robbed on an enormous large scale by the ruling class. As a result, state revenues were met with serious losses. This was one of the prime reasons for the increased rates of inflation. To overcome inflation, revenues had to be increased and expenditures reduced. How did they increase revenues? By increasing the price of consumer goods. And in order to decrease expenditures, there is no other way besides cutting social welfare structures. A very small number of people amassed a very large amount of wealth at the expense of public property. That means, in the final analysis, the wealth built by the working class was robbed by the state monopolists and their new bourgeois allies.</li>

<blockquote>
Though imperialism had been somewhat weakened by the drastic changes in the world after World War II, the epoch of imperialism has not ended. Mao said repeatedly: “We are still in a phase of imperialism and working class revolution.” The scientific analysis of Lenin, based on the fundamental principles of imperialism, is wholly valid and not outdated. The principles taught by comrades Lenin and Mao is the basis for our theory and practice. Marxism-Leninism-Maoism knows that imperialism is moribund. At the dawn of the world revolution, when imperialism is at its parasitic height, even then it will not go willingly out of this world. Imperialism can be eradicated permanently from the earth only when the oppressed classes and people of the world unite and make socialist revolution. But imperialism fights fiercely, crossing its own purported limits to survive, even when it is at the end of its life. That is the nature of imperialism.

<p>This also does well in describing fascism.</p>



<blockquote>
We are now in the 21st century and living in the global revolutionary era. Our present world has been subject to many changes since the deaths of Lenin and Mao. The history of development unquestionably proved Lenin’s revolutionary principles correct and Marxism-Leninism-Maoism immortal. But history has its own twists and turns. The birth of Bernsteinian and Kautskyite revisionism after the death of Engels, the emergence of Khrushchev-Brezhnev revisionism after the death of Stalin, and similarly, Hua-Deng revisionism arose after the death of Mao. By 1956, under the leadership of Khrushchev, capitalism was restored in the USSR under revisionist Brezhnevite leadership, the Soviet Union transformed thoroughly into a social-imperialist power. Under the leadership of the revisionist Hua-Deng clique in China, capitalism was restored and the foundation of social-imperialist power was laid.

<blockquote>
There is a myth that powerful countries like the US, Britain and Germany dominate the economy of China. This is false. The accumulated FDI that is added from all the countries like America, Britain, Germany, France and Japan was only 197.4 billion dollars in 2010, not even equal to half the FDI from Hong Kong. Similarly, some investment (as per the statistics) coming from Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and even from tax havens such as Macau also make up a substantial portion. But we cannot consider that these sums “dominate” the Chinese economy in any way. Thus the claim that the Chinese economy is primarily invested in and controlled by the Western powers is totally wrong.

<blockquote>
China has backed non-interference policies in the case of China, but in practice, utilizes its “backyard” countries as part of its global strategy. China gave all manner of support to the Rajapaksa government’s war against Tamil national liberation. The LTTE (the Liberation Tigers), and all Tamil people, have suffered immensely as a result. Thousands of Tamil people, from infants to fighters, were ruthlessly killed during the war, and continue to be murdered in state-sponsored pogroms. China repeatedly objects to United Nations proposals for war crimes investigations in Sri Lanka, as well as making significant profits on weapons sales during the war. China has continued to train the Sri Lankan armed forces long after the war’s end. Plans for US operations continue.

China has targeted the great continent of Africa that America, Europe and Japan have largely ignored, save for a few strategic resources. There are enormous reserves of minerals in Africa, such as oil, iron, copper and gold. 30% of all the world’s mineral deposits are located on the African continent, including 42% of the world’s bauxite, 38% of the uranium, 42% gold, 55% cobalt, 44% chromium, 82% of the manganese, 95% of the vanadium, and 73% of world platinum. China is the world’s top importer of many of these materials. In this way, China continues to exploit Africa in the neo-colonial style. China’s social-imperialists are now doing the work of the Western imperialists in Africa. Chinese economic dominance will grow rapidly in Africa in the very near future. China is now the single largest trade partner with Africa.

<blockquote>
Currently China is buying about 1/3rd of the oil from Africa, mainly from Angola and the Sudan. China is opening a new oil field valued at 800 million pounds in the Sudan, and has built a 900-mile pipeline there. It has invested 8 billion pounds, spending 1.2 billion to establish new oil facilities off the coast of Nigeria. China has become a strategic partner in oil and mining sectors in the Congo, at the same time acquiring retail trade development projects in each country’s capital, including mines in Zambia, Lesotho’s garment factories, and railways in the Central African Republic and Uganda. In order to supply Chinese imperialist schemes, there is a need for new markets for more raw materials and productive goods. China’s oil consumption is likely to increase at the least 10 percent each year. Depending on the level of demand, in 20 years this need will be insatiable, and hence the exploration for foreign oil. Already the world’s largest reserves are located in the US and the Western hemisphere. Saudi Arabia and Iraq contain 45 percent of the world’s oil reserves. In turn, relations with China have grown. The Sudan is the 4th largest oil supplier to China after Saudi Arabia, Iran and Oman.

In Africa, China implements socialism in words and imperialism in actions. The socialist foreign policy is characterized by intense exploitation of the working and middle classes, chanting their 5 principles: honesty, equality, mutual benefit, solidarity, joint development. “Mutual exchange,” “respect for diversity,” and “peace” are included in every statement issued by the imperialists for Africa. These words are pleasant to the local looting governments. In this way, China is cheating African workers and farmers who are themselves struggling for socialism. China is pressuring African traders by exposing them to bankruptcy. As China exports cheap goods to Africa, industries close down. The imperialists have destroyed the environment. China is making the demand from people for independent and united Africa, all the while subjugating and malforming its economies. Human rights are violated and bourgeois governments corrupted even further. There is a growing anger among Ghanaian farmers about China’s illegal mining excavations due to the pollution of drinking water. China has repeatedly violated the laws of host countries. In this way, the Chinese imperialists have intensified the neo-colonial style of exploitation rather than developing independent, self-reliant economies.

<blockquote>
China’s FDI is rapidly growing across Latin America. The imperialists operate like a mafia, looting the countries and destroying the environment. Trade between China and Latin America reached $261.2 billion by 2012. This is equivalent to China-Africa business figures, but China has gone even further in Latin America than in Africa. The development loans provided by the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China in 2005 were much larger than the loans provided by the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. These ongoing development activities are being carried out for the benefit of the imperialists, whose investments are in competition with one another.

<blockquote>
The two imperial economies in the BRICS, Russia and China, are accordingly the only two with the ability to invest large sums of finance capital. Brazil, India, and South Africa formed the precursor to BRICS, despite some contradictions and conflicts between these countries. BRICS was established to pursue common interests of developing economies, despite their various advantages and disadvantages. The largest and the fastest growing economy is of course China. The US, its next closest rival, has monopolized international institutions of credit like the IMF, the World Bank and other imperialist tools. There are no plans to withdraw the BRICS countries from IMF and World Bank schemes. But BRICS nations, including China, are looking to build new international economic and political institutions as a substitute for western-dominated meddling that comes with their expensive credit. BRICS leaders decided at its 2013 Durban meeting to set up an international development bank as an alternative to the World Bank. It is meant to join Chinese alternatives in competing with the World Bank to provide access to credit for infrastructure projects around the world. Member states will also set up a contingent reserve fund that will allow for $100 billion cash withdrawal for future fiscal
crises.

<blockquote>
Precisely in the way that the US dominates credit to underdeveloped countries, China desires to do the same with their various development banking schemes. According to the initial plan for this bank, the BRICS countries must provide equity balances. They decided on initial investments of 10 million dollars, but China obviously wants to invest much more. Large investments equal large returns. The BRICS countries signed the agreement in a meeting of the bank to reduce dependence on the US dollar and the euro. China’s economic power is growing as rapidly as its economy, while the United States recedes and destabilizes. This financial competition will increase, and with economic competition in the era of imperialism, aggravated by capitalist crisis, military competition will inevitably result.

China is not only a financial power but also a politically and militarily growing force. Between 2002 and 2011, China increased its defence budget by 170%. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), China now has the second largest military budget in the world. Only US military spending surpasses that of China. China is the world’s 5th largest nuclear power after the United States, Russia, Britain and France. The Chinese army has rapidly modernized over the last decade, and today it maintains a huge capacity for offensive war, acquiring every advantage for its navy and army to access strategic passes and islands. Flamboyant displays, such as shooting down satellites, have taken pride of place. According to SIPRI, China’s arms companies occupy 4th place among all competitors in the arms market. China is continually developing a military capability comparable to the United States and other imperialist countries. The wages paid to a division of soldiers in China, and other costs including food, homes, and training, costs less than in the US. Similarly, the cost of a tank, jet, or missile submarine in China is very low compared to the US, meaning that China can outfit and train its military at a drastically lower cost than the US, offsetting their seemingly lopsided defence budgets.

<p>The Chinese military is bigger and more capable then their finances would indicate. They should not be underestimated.</p>


<blockquote>
In other countries, China already intervenes militarily in many ways. While China has not yet emerged in major imperialist wars, it has been actively supporting local governments in suppressing revolutionary struggles, intervening in civil wars, people’s rebellions, and national liberation struggles. After Chadian President Idriss Deby recognized Taiwan and began doing business in the oil sector almost exclusively with Taiwan, China supported, both diplomatically and militarily, uprisings against him. Since then, China has seemingly won Deby to their side with immense bribery. China intervenes in many military conflicts in the world. For example, consider their role in the war against LTTE in Sri Lanka. China has strategically handed Pakistan nuclear weapons to change its fortunes in South Asia. Nepal and Afghanistan are subject to direct and indirect meddling. Other aspects of Chinese imperialist foreign policy include particular political and diplomatic support in Africa, military assistance, military advisors in foreign diplomatic missions, as well as interference by military personnel. Most of the military equipment sales China conducts are to regimes it favours. In this case, the imperialists of the other countries and the imperialists of China do not disagree. China is already one of the most active imperial states. It is no surprise that China had become the third largest arms exporter by 2012.

The US regime is constantly looking for ways to isolate and overcome Chinese competition for markets. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was one such scheme, a free trade forum for all countries in the Pacific Rim except China. Although Donald Trump cancelled this deal, it is unavoidable that such agreements and schemes will continue to arise. Since Japan and South Korea are not allowed to cancel, they declared that they would continue to cooperate under this framework. Two competitive economic/political/military alliances lead in the global capitalist-imperialist system. International trade war has been announced from the United States and other imperialist countries against China in the WTO, although China still compromises with the other countries in exploiting backward countries by utilizing international frameworks such as the WTO. All major imperial states that are part of the WTO are violating its rules, continually cheating member states and mutually defrauding one another. To seize market share in foreign markets, they sell their goods at the lowest prices and flood the markets with goods. Export subsidies are utilized. Contracts to their corporations will guarantee military assistance. Corruption is built into the superstructure.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Like the United States, China has also set up its own free enterprises independent from its rivals. Thus, China is attempting to establish economic/political/military alliances against the US and its close allies. One example is the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), mostly obtaining between China and Russia, wherein they hope to make the SCO their military bloc and BRICS their economic
bloc.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Internationally, China’s economic clout has risen. By financing America’s public and private debt, China has gained many advantages, including insolation from the economic crises of the last decade. There are few opportunities for the United States to attack or restrict China. The US and China support one another on a number of issues, but their continued and intensifying rivalry will become increasingly dangerous.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Although there is not an agenda of direct war between America, China, and Russia in the near future, there are many indirect wars on the agenda. The US is aggressively attempting to surround Russia and China, and only China has the means to outmanoeuvre and sidestep their schemes. NATO is waging war in Afghanistan, Syria, haphazardly in Africa, and elsewhere. It will compete with Russia for the Arctic. China is issued daily ultimatums from the western bloc. The China/Russia bloc has already emerged as a major threat to US domination in the imperialist struggle to regulate the distribution of oil and key minerals in order to meet growing market needs for Chinese imperialism.
