<blockquote>
“Multivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence.”*
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“The major causal criteria of temporality, biological plausibility, consistency and lack of alternative explanations are well supported…The evidence that large income differences have damaging health and social consequences is strong and in most countries inequality is increasing. Narrowing the gap will improve the health and wellbeing of populations.”*
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“We find that crime rates and inequality are positively correlated (within each country and, particularly, between countries), and it appears that this correlation reflects causation from inequality to crime rates, even controlling for other crime determinants.”*
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“Drawing on harmonised data covering the OECD countries over the past 30 years, the econometric analysis suggests that income inequality has a negative and statistically significant impact on subsequent growth. In particular, what matters most is the gap between low income households and the rest of the population. In contrast, no evidence is found that those with high incomes pulling away from the rest of the population harms growth…Redistribution policies via taxes and transfers are a key tool to ensure the benefits of growth are more broadly distributed and the results suggest they need not be expected to undermine growth.”*
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“In two different data sets covering 34 countries, economic growth was not associated with increases in happiness when it was accompanied by growing income inequality.”*
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“The conventional explanation of raising income inequality is often referred to as the market forces hypothesis. Global forces have led to structural economic changes in which we now have a two-tiered economy: a highly skilled and highly paid economy at the top of the income distribution and a poorly skilled and poorly paid economy at the bottom of the income distribution… Although there is no question that the data does support the market forces hypothesis, the data also show that these forces may have been exacerbated by the deterioration of important labor market institutions.”*
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“Specifically, we posit that greater levels of income inequality could lead low-income youth to perceive a lower return to investment in their own human capital. Such an effect would offset any potential “aspirational” effect coming from higher educational wage premiums. The data are consistent with this prediction: low-income youth are more likely to drop out of school if they live in a place with a greater gap between the bottom and middle of the income distribution.”*
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“The comparative evidence indicates no adverse impact of greater equality on investment or work effort, nor on growth of productivity or output, trade balances, inflation, or unemployment. On the contrary, higher levels of equality are associated with stronger productivity growth and trade performance, and possibly with higher investment and lower inflation.”*
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“There has been a large rise in savings by Americans in the top 1% of the income or wealth distribution over the past 35 years, which we call the saving glut of the rich. The saving glut of the rich has been as large as the global saving glut, and it has not been associated with an increase in investment. Instead, this rise in savings has been associated with substantial dissaving by the non-rich and dissaving by the government.”*
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“We find that increasing the income share of the poor and the middle class actually increases growth while a rising income share of the top 20 percent results in lower growth—that is, when the rich get richer, benefits do not trickle down. “
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Parental household annual income is also directly positively correlated with child college attendance rate and directly negatively correlated with female teenage birth rate. These correlations are virtually exactly linear and are extremely statistically significant.*

<blockquote>
“Although the overall macroeconomic impact of immigration that takes place in a given year is modest compared to other factors, the compounding role of foreign-born innovators and other kinds of workers becomes significant to long-run economic growth…The contributions of immigrants to the labor force reduce the prices of some goods and services, which benefits consumers in a range of sectors including child care, food preparation, house cleaning and repair, and construction. Moreover, new arrivals and their descendants also provide a major source of demand in sectors such as housing, benefiting residential real estate markets. To the extent that immigrants flow disproportionately to where wages are rising and local labor demand is strongest, they help equalize wage growth geographically, making labor markets more efficient and lowering slack. Immigration also contributes to the nation’s economic growth. Most obviously, immigration supplies workers, which increases GDP and has helped the United States avoid the fate of stagnant economies created by purely demographic forces—in particular, an aging (and, in the case of Japan, a shrinking) workforce.”

<blockquote>
“An estimated 1,926,390 native‐​born Americans, 106,431 illegal immigrants, and 52,424 legal immigrants were incarcerated in 2017. The incarceration rate for native‐​born Americans was 1,471 per 100,000; 756 per 100,000 for illegal immigrants; and 364 per 100,000 for legal immigrants in 2017 (Figure 1). Illegal immigrants are 49 percent less likely to be incarcerated than native‐​born Americans. Legal immigrants are 75 percent less likely to be incarcerated than natives.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“…a one-standard-deviation increase in a workplace’s immigrant diversity is associated with a 1.6 percent rise in the wages of the average worker there. And that effect is more pronounced on a larger scale: a one-standard-deviation rise in a metro area’s immigrant diversity is associated with a 5.8 percent increase in that area’s wages.”

<blockquote>
“In a survey conducted between January and May, 52 percent of U.S. Muslims said homosexuality should be accepted by society — an increase of 25 percentage since 2007. Comparatively, only 34 percent of white evangelical Protestants said they believed homosexuality should be accepted, the smallest percentage of any group surveyed.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“Using an array of administrative data sources and original experiments I show that militarized “special weapons and tactics” (SWAT) teams are more often deployed in communities of color, and—contrary to claims by police administrators—provide no detectable benefits in terms of officer safety or violent crime reduction, on average. However, survey experiments suggest that seeing militarized police in news reports erodes opinion toward law enforcement. Taken together, these findings suggest that curtailing militarized policing may be in the interest of both police and citizens.”*
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“Findings suggest that white police are, indeed, more racially resentful, more likely to see blacks as violent, and more likely to minimize anti-black discrimination than are white nonpolice. Black police officers, however, are not significantly more racially conservative than black citizens on any of the measures examined, lending modest evidence to the “selection effect” theory of Police Personality.”*
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“African-American prisoners who are convicted of murder are about 50% more likely to be innocent than other convicted murderers. Part of that disparity is tied to the race of the victim. African Americans imprisoned for murder are more likely to be innocent if they were convicted of killing white victims. Only about 15% of murders by African Americans have white victims, but 31% of innocent African-American murder exonerees were convicted of killing white people.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“Here, we resolve these challenges and present evidence that proactive policing—which involves systematic and aggressive enforcement of low-level violations—is positively related to reports of major crime. We examine a political shock that caused the New York Police Department (NYPD) to effectively halt proactive policing in late 2014 and early 2015. Analysing several years of unique data obtained from the NYPD, we find that civilian complaints of major crimes (such as burglary, felony assault and grand larceny) decreased during and shortly after sharp reductions in proactive policing. “*
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“Overall, average property and violent crime rates are substantially higher in black communities. However, disadvantage has the same patterns of effects on crime in white and black neighborhoods. Hence crime rates for racially distinct areas generally approach one another when structural conditions are controlled. These patterns are particularly striking for violent crime. Gross rates of violence are nearly three times as high in black as in white neighborhoods, but the net race difference in violent crime is small and nonsignificant for the vast majority of contrasts between similarly disadvantaged communities. And even when race differences persist, residents confront much less violence in black neighborhoods with low disadvantage than in either black or white communities with extreme disadvantage. Taken as a whole, these findings clearly substantiate Sampson and Wilson's contention that the sources of crime are invariant across race and are rooted largely in the structural differences among communities.”*

<blockquote>
“A difference-in-differences design finds census places with Black Lives Matter protests experience a 15% to 20% decrease in police homicides over the ensuing five years, around 300 fewer deaths. The gap in lethal use-of-force between places with and without protests widens over these subsequent years and is most prominent when protests are large or frequent.”*

<h2>4. Labor</h2>

<blockquote>
“In this research note it is shown that, by applying cointegration and causality techniques to U.S. state-level panel data, there is a negative long-run relationship between unionization and income inequality in the United States, and that causality is unidirectional from unionization to inequality.”*
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“For a time, economists believed that labor markets were nonetheless competitive. But that conventional wisdom was vaporized by a series of empirical studies that suggest that labor market power is real and significant. A number of studies, summarized here, have found, for example, that when wages fall by 1 percent, only about 2 to 3 percent of workers leave, at most.
If labor markets were really competitive, we might expect the figure to be closer to 9 or 10 percent. Other studies have found that employer concentration has been increasing over time and that this concentration is associated with lower wages across labor markets.
In our working paper, we take a first cut at estimating the effects of monopsony on both employment rates and wages. Employment, we calculate, is 5 to 18 percent less than it would be in a competitive market. (Here is Marx’s reserve army of the unemployed.) This effect can explain all of the decline in employment rates among prime-age men observed by labor economists.
Given the way our economy works historically, labor’s share of economic output should be about 74 percent if labor markets were perfectly competitive. Because of employers’ power to drive down wages, labor’s share of economic output falls to somewhere between 51 and 64 percent. This transfer significantly increases income inequality.”

<h2>5.  Minimum Wage</h2>

<blockquote>
“Under our preferred model specification and estimation sample, we estimate that between 1979 and 1989, the decline in the real value of the minimum wage is responsible for 30 to 55 percent of the growth of lower tail inequality in the female, male, and pooled wage distributions”*
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“A ten percent increase in the minimum wage raises that 5th percentile wage by about 2.9 percent. The study also finds evidence of ripple effects as the minimum wage increases wages for workers who make more than the minimum—and that these ripple effects dissipate the further one moves up the wage ladder. The same ten percent minimum wage increase raises the wages of workers at the 10th percentile of wages by about 1.6 percent and raises the wages of those in the 20th percentile by a statistically significant 0.7 percent. After the 25th percentile, wage effects are typically very small and statistically indistinguishable from zero.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“Raising the minimum wage reduces poverty in most developing countries. But the impact is modest because the minimum wage applies to only a minority of poor workers; in particular, it does not cover workers in the large informal sectors. And raising the minimum wage creates losers as well as winners among poor households—depending on employment effects, the wage distribution, and effects on the household head—pulling some out of poverty while pushing others in. Raising the minimum wage could be part of a comprehensive poverty-reduction package but should not be the only, or even the main, tool to reduce poverty…Almost all estimates suggest that a 1% increase in the minimum wage results in less than a 1% decrease in employment, implying that the total earnings of formal sector workers increase when minimum wages rise…Taken together, the evidence for developing countries suggests that a higher minimum wage generally leads to an increase in total earnings for workers as a group…Studies using aggregate country-level data to examine the correlations between minimum wages and poverty have generally found that in developing countries higher minimum wages are correlated with lower poverty rates”

<blockquote>
“A 10 percent increase in the minimum wage reduces non-drug suicides among adults with high school or less by 3.6 percent; a 10 percent increase in the EITC reduces suicides among this group by 5.5 percent.”*
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“I find that long-run employment increases slightly until the minimum wage is equal to 60% of the full-time median wage (Kaitz index) as higher search effort offsets lower vacancy posting. In addition, raising the minimum wage reallocates workers towards full-time jobs and high-productivity firms. Total hours worked and output peak at Kaitz indices of 73% and 79%.”*
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“Housing for Health, a division of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, places chronically homeless people into housing and connects them to a case manager for support services, such as substance abuse treatment. For every $1 spent on the program, the county government saved $1.20 in health care and other social service costs, according to a report published on Tuesday by RAND Corporation, a research firm…Altogether, the (housing) program resulted in a nearly 60 percent reduction in those public service costs... In the year before receiving housing and case management, the cost per person was $38,146; in the year after entering the program, the per-person cost was $15,358. Even after taking into account the cost of the housing program, the county saw a 20 percent net savings.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“A main finding of the study is that the expected homeless rate in a community increases sharply once median rental costs exceed 32% of median income, providing empirical evidence for the widely used definition of a housing cost burden at 30% of income... For example, we find that maintaining a rent/income ratio less than 32% may be an important target for communities in order to avoid sharp increases in homelessness.”*
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“The average life span of a homeless person was shorter by about 17.5 years than that recorded for the general population. The average age at death of a homeless male was 56.27 years old (SD 10.38), and 52.00 years old (SD 9.85) of a homeless female.”*
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“In addition, a national study found that teenagers had higher earnings and lower incarceration rates as adults for each additional year their family used a voucher or lived in public housing.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“In 28 of 30 comparisons between countries at similar levels of economic development, socialist countries showed more favorable PQL outcomes.”*
