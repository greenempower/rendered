<p>This book shall be of particular interest to us as it does a good job at defining human nature in scientific and relatively objective terms that generally allign with the objectives of our organization.</p>

<p>Sapolsky recounts himself as a young person fantasizing about torturing and killing Hitler.</p>

<p>Sapolsky expresses a personal fear and repulsion to violence, but describes a society that in so many ways worships it.</p>
