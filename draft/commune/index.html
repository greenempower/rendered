<h1>GEM: Commune / Campus</h1>

<p>I would like a digital and eventually a physical commune space...</p>

<p>The digital commune will commence with my renting server space in the cloud.</p>

<p>The digital commune will likely function as an open service. Nothing will be of charge. We will provide storage and processing space in the cloud essentially, with the expectation that our members are leftists.</p>

<p>We shall also provide and promote platforms, which are superior to existing capitalist own companies offerings.</p>


<p>The physical campus will give us an address. It will house a datacenter where we will provide cheap computing services. It will provide a fabrication and industrial plant and do all types of production</p>

<p>The campus will provide a great number of social services such as meeting and organizing space for our fellow comrades.</p>

<p>Most over part of the campus will be partitioned and provisioned to others.</p>


<!--
<p>So I am very excited to start a commune.</p>

<p>I can be a wonderful place where forward thinking people like myself of all ages can get together and do meaningful work to make the world a better place.</p>

<p>The commune will be a center for our services additionally; and the commune will be run by it's members in a anarcho-communist fashion.</p>

<p>I will likely need to start a funding campaign to get this going and buy/develop the property.</p>
