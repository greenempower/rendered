--- Peer Networking Initiative ---
There should be a peer based networking infrastructure initiative.

Fundamentally peers should be RF-enabled devices capable of communicating directly by relaying and keeping track of their constituent public keys.

The network should depend on relaying, caching and defered execution.

Users can host web content without worrying about censorship or hostile economics.

The protocol supports each peer having a rich interface for managing content and other peers.

Content can be co-authored by many peers to make it more difficult for powerful entities to cancel individual peers irl.

The protocol should not be economically exploitable (propagate existing inequities) like ethereum is. Resources can be allocated through networks of trust and maybe a simple credit system.
