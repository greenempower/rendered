<h1>GEM: Our Vision for America</h1>

<p>America is a land of such great potential yet we are being strangeled by fascism.</p>

<p>Assuming it is not too late for America, this is our vision for a future America and methods for how it may be achieved.</p>

<p>Our approach to America is fundamentally revolutionary.</p>

<p>First there will need to be a successful effort to adequatly bend government from the inside. The first leftist president may be mandated in this scenario and they will need a basis of support from bellow the heirarchy.</p>

<p>The basis will serve as the enablement of a true revolution. They will set into motion the conditions that will allow the mass revolutionaries to enact coordinated and substancial action to overthrow our fascist rule.</p>

<p>While the internal government actors are in place they shall also attempt to take action to advance socialism.</p>

<p>This shall chiefly manifest itself in populist economic reforms.</p>

<p>But primary legislation shall be enacted in pursuit of fullfulling the revolution.</p>
