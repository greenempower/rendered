DRAFT OF AN ART VISUALIZATION PROPAGANDA SYSTEM

GEM should have a system of generating high-fidelity art and propaganda material for the intent of marketing products and initiatives and for the purpose of creating media pieces with entertainment and recreational value.

A specific suite of tools should be put together to do this.
First there should be a standard rendering tool in GEMx that can raytrace scenes individually and as a stream, while this tool should also provide for a wealth or high end affects in the orthographic space operating on pixels and vectors.

I do not intend to create a dichotomy between artistic design and CAD that exists now in modern PC systems. For me the line between technical and artistic considerations is too blurry.

There should be a defined set of functions and objects relating to design within the registry.
And there should be some special class of data structures and complex operations that are registered and applicable to this field such as matrices and algabreic manipulations.
