--- GEM Linga ---

-- 5/9/22
gem linga is a wip system for studying languages
specifically by providing a tool for generating tailored ebooks,
allowing the reader to learn through more realistic texts

and the ebooks should be vocalized so the learner can listen while doing other things such as taking a walk

I had begun work on this some months ago but sadly ran into a road block when I realized that the machine translation models I was working with aren't adequate for the nature of this task since it requires atomization.

So now I am taking more care to this as a lingustics project, but I hope to have a container out with a simple interface that meets the basic requirement of creating spanish/english ebooks before long or after I have time free after finishing with my tefl course in the next couple of months.
