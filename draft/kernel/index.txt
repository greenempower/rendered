GEM KERNEL

There may be with time a desire for an alternative kernel to Linux.
It should happen as neoliberal politics and licensing may advance on Linux.
Or when there is a desire for many features which cannot be properly addressed by the historic design of Linux.

super-kernel,
the super-kernel should be implemented in the GEMx system as the beginning of a
standalone kernel.
It should be invoked by init and it should begin to implement the macro features of an eventual GEM kernel such as managing GEMx specific modules such as storag
e and registry.
A transition should see a growth of features at this layer and a dissabling of f
features at the Linux kernel under-layer.

I should begin some work on a new kernel maybe in Rust/D/C++.
It should just run in VM as baremetal with maybe a slightly larger scope than defined earlier.
