GEMX COMPRESSION SUBSYSTEM

GEMx should employ a central compression method that words by agregating system data and metadata and by procuring an 'entropy file'.

And the entropy file is 'federated' in a p2p network like the registry is and several other systems within GEMx.

And the registry system should likely play a large part in producing this 'entropy file' while another system manages it otherwise.
