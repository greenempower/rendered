--- GEM Graphics Kernel ---

GFK is a process I am first developing to power graphics rendering in the Voxim game. And eventually it should integrate as the primary graphics module in GEMOS/GEMx.

At it's core GFK should support an application in:
- initializing context
- accepting commands
- sharing buffers
- executing custom DSL scripts
And GFX should provide a linkable API for executing in this protocol.
And as time passes more higher order functionality should be encapsulated by the GEMx registry.

There should be a simple spec of commands including,
- registring an application and it's components
- requesting for output buffers and display devices
- passing buffers in arbitrary or structured formats
- passing DSL scripts
- controlling the execution of DSL scripts

DSL scripts should simply be small Lua scripts which can execute against a formal spec of functions and tables.
Scripts are intended to command graphics rendering or do more general compute.


GFK might be written in Rust and/or C++.

Todo:
- Find a good system for doing IPC.

Ideas:
- GFK should eventually or initially support WebASM for DSL scripts.
