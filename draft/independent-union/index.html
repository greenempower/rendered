<h1>GEM Draft: Independent Union</h1>

<p>I call for the creation of an independent union comprised of individuals who are independently employed (self-employed, contractors, free lancers, non-capitalist actors, etc) or generally unemployed or unproductive (likely by no fault of their own).</p>

<p>The union will provide the capacity to leverage the combined active and reserved labor power of these peoples who, as far as I am aware, are currently not united against capitalism.</p>

<p>I would be one of the first to join this union.</p>

<p>For example, in modern America after the pendemic there is a large labor shortage. Businesses cannot get enough workers willing to work and are having a high turnover rate for those who do agree to work.</p>

<p>This is a good oportunity to demand higher wages and better social programs and pollicies in exchange for our reserve labor.</p>
