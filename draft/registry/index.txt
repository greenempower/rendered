STANDARD FLEXIBLE REGISTRY SERVER

I am designing a central registry server for use on a web server and locally within a GEMx installation.

This registry should be the primary means of resource management within GEMx.

The registry will support revisioning of all it's entries.

The registry will encapsulate:
- Code Objects in a standard representation in the format of a function with inputs and outputs. 
- Data Objects in the form of key value mapped tables or 'dictionaries'.
- File Objects much like standard Unix files as binary blobs with headers and extensions.

Each unique object has a unique global ID.

Additionally the registry should support metadata in the forms of tags and other attributes on all of it's objects.

The registry may additionally keep an entropy file as a means of compression.


The unique ID's should be truly global and networked just like IPFS or Ethereumm resources are. They are not specific to individual computers so I will keep a master record on my servers while a client may choose to download only a subset.
