<h1>GEM Draft: Internet Reform Campaign</h1>

<p>Effort needs to be made to take back the net from the hands of capitalists and to put the power back into the hands of the people and specifically leftists like ourselves.</p>

<p>It's not even possible anymore to find a reasonably priced hosting service that is in any way progressive.</p>

<p>AWS owns most everything and that is a problem.</p>

<p>We cannot trust AWS with our code and data. They will crush our leftist efforts if they feel the need to do so.</p>

<p>First we will need a hosting service that is practically priced and that is run by leftists.</p>
