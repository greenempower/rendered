GEMx Semi-graphical Interface

I have been writting about the semi-graphical interface system...
Essentially it defines a streaming console which has the characteristics of an ssh session and vnc.

It may actually be similar the an HTML server with text&tags, compressed graphics, vectors, keyboard and mouse interacton, etc...

a file format that is a synthesis of the gif compact image and animation format and of vector graphics with curves, text, gradients, textures, etc
I'd like to store the portraits and head shots on greenempower.org in this format and use it in the streaming console project so that I can get something that looks nice and that is more compressable and pleasant to work with than a jpeg
