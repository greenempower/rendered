<h1>Social Networking and Organizing Hub</h1>
<p>I am conceptualizing another site that could be a bit like facebook in function, but is leftist and much better.</p>
<p>It will leverage a lot of existing protocols and services/innovations made by our greater organization.</p>
<p>This could be a hub for identity management of The Green Empower Organization.</p>
<p>Measures will be made to avoid becoming exploitative to users. This may mean more reliance on donations and income generated by Green Empower. It may also require more active involvement and investement by the user base themselves to maintain the platform.</p>
<p>We will do strong, but not brutal or authoritarian modding. We may need modding to help enforce a safe environment for everyone involved so that they can better interact and express themselves on the platform. When possible moderation actions will be done by the community and all modderation will follow a code of conduct as a guideline. There will be a sort of justice system which allows for recourse and oversite by the community on actions.</p>
<p>We will not support blocking or if we do it will be a different sort of feature then what other platforms provide.</p>
<p>Blocking prevents the free flow of information and creates of culture of fear and reactionaryism.</p>
<p>There are other better ways, such as proper moderation, which deal with issues of harrassment and others reasons why someone might want to block another.</p>
<p>Spam will be dissaloud and dealt with.</p>
<p>Harsher administrative actions will be decentralized and softened to an optimal degree.</p>
<p>People's property (their data) will not be wiped and there will be opportunity for redemption.</p>
</p>Overall moderation will be treated as a necessarily evil.</p>
<p>Of course this is anarchist so we will minimize power disparities and heirarchies. Decisions will be made collectively.</p>
