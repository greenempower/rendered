GEM DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT

As I am not satisfied by existing DEs.
This new DE should be capable of managing many windows and instances of apps without confusion.
Using XFCE and KDE I find that tabs and windows get lost very easily and I waste time search through them.

GEM DE should define a one alternative to a window that is essentially an activity and a handle to a temporary markup language file object which can be written too.

Then a viewport and frame buffer system which can be rendered to by a layer which I current think of as being called 'vkmod'.

And finally a X11/Wayland compatibility 'window'.
