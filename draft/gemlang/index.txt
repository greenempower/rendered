GEM PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE VM REPRESENTATION AND SPECIFICATION

There should be a special programming language for primary use within GEMx.

It should integrate with draft/registry so that it's entries are coded in gemlang (functions) and gemlang objects.

There should be exposed primitives of all native sizes and these should generally map as intended to real memory resources. ex f32 -> 32 bit float or i64 -> 64 bit signed integer.
