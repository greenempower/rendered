<h1>GEM Draft: Cluster</h1>

<p>I will begin deployment of a multinational cluster of cloud server configurations.</p>

<p>The plan is still being developed as I do research, but here is current.</p>

<p>I will purchace 1 small Storage VPS from Hostens for a year period for ~$43.20. Additionally I will purchase another small Linux VPS or Container VPS. The two instances will be virtually merged using a technology such as SSI.</p>

<p>Potentially I will get free VPS instances from Oracle Cloud, Google Cloud and Heroku. I don't trust these companies especially as they are American.</p>

<p>I don't particularly trust any of these companies so I will not give them access to any particularly sensitive information. If it's private then this server will not possess the keys.</p>

<p>At home I have one functioning PC for dedicated use and other PCs which can be retrofited without much investment. SBCs are always an option. These can be used to make a local cluster and the cluster can be reversed proxy'd to join the rest of the global cluster. The biggest thing stopping this from happening is my home network, but with time that issue may be lessened substantially.</p>
