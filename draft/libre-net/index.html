<h1>GEM Draft: Libre Network</h1>

<p>We call for a network of general purpose computing devices that is completely free of interference and regulation of the fascist complex (government and it's corporations).</p>

<p>These devices will be manufactured locally and largely use long range mesh communications for networking.</p>

<p>The libre network will also need to become independ of neoliberal authorities who are subject to enforcement by parts of the fascist complex such as the legal system. (ex. a domain belonging to an independent actor cannot be forfeited on the whim of a fascist.)</p>
