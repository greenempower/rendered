SINGULAR STORAGE ENGINE/DRIVER FOR GEMX

GEMx is currently being implemented in a virtual machine.
In the 'GEM Layer' I'd like all storage mediums to only be exposed through this engine.

The storage engine will expose virtual devices for the registry and other apps can have access to these devices.
