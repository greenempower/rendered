<h1>GEMX Systems: Data</h1>

<p>GEMX will store all data as objects and each object is a file stored in /data/objects/</p>

<p>The file objects are named semi-randomly.</p>

<p>There will be a registry and a general system for keeping meta data and dealing with objects in an intelligeble manner.</p>

<p>Each object will have tags and identifiers associated with it.</p>

<p>All objects are compressed and encrypted.</p>

<p>Objects will be compressed via an intelligent and semi-autonomous (ML like) algorithm leveraging hard-coded intel and aggregate data known to the system.</p>
