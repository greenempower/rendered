<h1>GEMX Systems: Browser</h1>

<p>The GEMX Browser system may eventually include a fresh browser implementation but currently it will not.</p>

<p>The Browser System implements a sort of hypervisor manager. Each page/page group is isolated/sandboxed and provisioned by the hypervisor. This allows for more fine grained resource allocation and monitoring while preventing any one web page from taking up too much resources and ensuring that they can be put to sleep when not being used.</p>

<p>Low resource mode: A page or page group can be opened in this mode. This mode is usefull for when it is necessary to open a large number of tabs at once for research purposes or otherwise. Each page is trimmed down and restricted so that they consume a minimum of resources and do not bog down your system in large numbers.</p>
