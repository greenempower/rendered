GEMx DRAFT

this is a subset of current GEMx related material

there should be several platform targets for GEMx apps,
possibly:
- vanilla browser
- modified browser
- mobile
- virtualized

like in Python the platform can be query'd and the app can respond to that at run time


a full dev suite shouldn't be integrated into the X layer,
instead the X layer should provide an advanced and productive environment for working with the native script and tools and additionally a basic root console
