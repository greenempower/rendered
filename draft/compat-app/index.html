GEM COMPAT APPLICATION CLASS

A Compatibility Application should be an application which trivilly runs in GEMx but also importantly consumer OSs such as Android, iOS and Windows.

This is assuming that for many of these devices such as a low end Android phone it will be very impractical to attempt to ship an entire and virtualized GEMx installation.
