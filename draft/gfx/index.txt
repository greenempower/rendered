ADVANCED GRAPHICAL INTERFACE AND SYSTEM FOR GEMX

So there should be a simple and perhaps unified graphical inteface in GEMx.
It should sit atop vulkan and apply to raster graphics if not the larger interfaces API.

It should simplify all common tasks in rendering orthographic and 3D applications while providing a solid API to build upon for everything else.
And it should also do this by encapsulating and binding other modules.
