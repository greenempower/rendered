Essential Mod

# notes:
# - mekanism already implements nuclear reactors
# - should add a space mod
# - still need a solid world gen mod (candidates: OTG, Traverse Reforged, Oh The Biomes You'll Go, Environmental, )
# - transportation mods
# - possibly add Mystcraft but that's resource intensive on the server
# - add a unified ore dictionary
# - maybe add Forestry
# - add a mobs mod
# - one or two farming mods
# - gun/war mod (Flan's Mod) with Communist pack.
# - a navigation mod
# - so I'm not intent on adding Mystcraft. instead I'll have a few dimensions via other mods
# - potential mod for wolves and horses... (candidates: Wolf Armor and Storage Legacy, Doggy Talents, )
# - add a seasons mod (candidates: Serene Seasons, )
# - too bad Reika's mods aren't updated :( (should find alternatives to ChromatiCraft, GeoStrata and RotaryCraft)
# - maybe add a redstone mod for easier building of redstone computers and other structures

# likely candidates:
# - Sulfuric, HeIium, Magnesium, 
# - 

# considering:
# - Modular Powersuits
# - Baubles
# - Lycanites Mobs
# - Lycanites Redux (resource pack)
# - Rustic
# - Forestry
# - Immersive Engineering
# - Tetra
# - Transport
# - YUNG's Better Caves
# - Alchemistry
# - Construct's Armory
# - Hatchery
# - Reliquary
# - Underground Biomes
# - Project Intelligence
# - Thaumic Augmentation

# client:
# - BetterF3
# - Dynamic Surroundings

# keeping in mind:
# - Vampirism - Become a vampire!
# - AbyssalCraft
# - AstikorCarts [Horse Carts]
# - Aquaculture 2
# - BetterNether
# - BountifulBaubles (but Modular Powersuites already provides armor)
# - Botanical Machinery (not for 1.12.2)
# - Weather, Storms & Tornadoes

# other:
# - Advanced Peripherals (CC)
# - Chunk Loaders (but too expensive for the server)
# - Energy Converters

# performance:
