there must be an open/red&green standard in opposition to corporate Minecraft.

there will be a formal implementation of a distributed ledger in opposition to Ethereum drawing from red/cooperative/enviromentalist ideology and the DisCO Manifesto.

there must be genre in contrast to asian pop music and entertainment media that remains relatively uncorrupted by vapid capitalism

there must be a militant social order in the west and elsewhere that stands in strong oposition to rabid anti-communism and general fascitalism

I think there should be a system for handling resources across the gem ecosystem. Something that makes it easy to reference and utilize assets from multiple mirrors (including IPFS or the central store) using special id's and tags.

maybe there should be a GEM Remote package. an extension of GEMx for doing processing on the server

I must have a better solution to managing large numbers of tabs in Firefox and maybe Chrome.

should develop a digital distribution system and I have a short domain in mind
EXAMPLE_DOMAIN: sho.rt
sho.rt/@<namespace> : a namespace for profiles, groups, ...
sho.rt/u/<username> : user accounts
i.sho.rt/<asset>    : static images assets such as jpegs, pngs and gifs
v.sho.rt/<video>    : videos
i.sho.rt/<asset>    : binary images where other labels don't apply
r.sho.rt/<repo>     : repos alternatively /repos/
s.sho.rt/<source>   : source code repos either git or <source>/git , or this could be social
c.sho.rt/<program>  : executable code programs
h.sho.rt            : hub specific assets

I should provide a form for others to register namespaces.

This system should have a piece of software for itself.

there should be a general object and code system
a table should be kept locally of instances of objects and functions
along with namespaces they are labeled under and tags
the remote resource server should keep these under url's
objects can be json like dictionaries and functions be as normal functions,
which are the smallest element of code with inputs and outputs
revisions and versions of each object and function should be tracked
