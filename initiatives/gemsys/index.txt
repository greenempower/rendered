GEM SYSTEM PROJECT

GEMSYS is just the code name for this until I buy the final domain.

I am developing a broad computing system with several layers,
the bottom level root layer is currently called V or GEMv.
It is simply a minimal yocto built root image with kernel, filesystem and only the libraries needed to run the next layer and additionally some basic utilities for a fallback environment.

The higher layer is the X layer or GEMx. It is a special process that creates and exposes the environment and it's interfaces.
The environment is characterized by it's interfaces and specifically it's registry which holds all data.

But honestly more importantly to this project than technical implementation is the larger mission so I'll say that.

Personally and immediately GEMSYS serves as system to accelerate all my immediate work reguarding simulation, visualization, design, engineering, art, study, networking and development.

But a larger goal of GEMSYS is to create a more capable and accessable environment that everyone can use and enjoy. It should be to challenge the big tech/state hegemony and capitalism broadly through licensing and other leveraging of the system.
