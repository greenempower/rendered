<h1>Prospect of Red (Communist/Anarchist) Supremacy in the United States of America</h1>

<p>I shall analyze and report the routes and probabilities of achieving wide scale support of leftist ideology among the population and power structures of the USA.</p>

<p>I shall assume that most Americans are relatively progressive and that the integrity of our 'democracy' in reflecting this is very shallow.</p>

<p>I shall assume that on average America's are right wing biased as compared to the rest of the world, but are still capable of adapting and thriving in our leftist society with time and generations.</p>

<p>If it is the case that most Americans are already rather left wing or could reasonably be made so then our plan of overthrowing the capitalists becomes much easier as we can mostly disreguard internal ideological friction. The situation increasingly becomes that of direct warfare against the oppressors.</p>

<p>So we shall conduct research on the state of the American people and institutions and report them from the perspective of our ideal development.</p>
