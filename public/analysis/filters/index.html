<h1>Natural and Political Filters</h1>

<p>There seem to be a number of filters in place in society that among other things determine what type of people come to power and what they do when they are in power.</p>

<p>Filters are highly relevant in the context of capitalism as they seem to manifest themselves very negatively here.</p>

<p>We wonder why all of these people in power seem to be so greedy, but maybe that is a filter. Maybe we are allowing the greediest of all people assume power consistently.</p>
