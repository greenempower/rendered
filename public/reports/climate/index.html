		<h1>GEM Climate Report</h1>

		<p>Here shall be our practical report on climate change.</p>

		<p>As an anticapitalist organization we are not concerned so much with maintaining the economies of developed nations at this point. As we will not waste time doing that we shall concern ourself with preparing future production for climate change and also ensuring that it achieves what current production can not in terms of serving the people rather than the profits of private owners.</p>

		<p>Climate change will very likely disrupt the worlds existing power structure and it is our perogative that we use that oportunity to dismantel and replace capitalism.</p>

		<p>So this document shall be of use to individuals, families and communities in surviving climate change and collaborating with each other to do so in a productive and mutually beneficial way.</p>
