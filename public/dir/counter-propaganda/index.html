		<h1>Countering Regressive Propaganda</h1>
		<p>These are phrases that are identified as propaganda.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Right to work / Right to earn a living</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Additionally we shall analyze and break down the propaganda that the right wing engine is producing. Their messaging is actually increadibly sophisticated and nefarious.</p>

		<p>We shall target and create dosseirs of prominent right wing propagandists and stop them in their tracks.</p>

		<p>This stuff is dark and upsetting yet it reachers a great deal of people.</p>

		<p>The notion that a person should work to give their children a better life than they had is broken as it supports nepotism which is a detrement to society. Rather we advocate that people should work to make the world better than where they found it. That statement is actually positive as it does not so clearly promote human suffering which is what comes with nepotism in contrast.</p>
