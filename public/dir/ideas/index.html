<h1>Ideas</h1>

<p>Fascistland: A television news network parody on fox news and neoconservative propaganda such as Ben Shapiro, Steven Crowder and PragerU.</p>

<p>It could be a joke and work to expose to outlandish racism and stupidity of the propaganda while also being funny.</p>

<p>--- Termal Overlay On Background ---</p>
<p>Be great if I could watch a KPop video in the background while typing over it in a transparent (except for text and wizard) terminal.</p>

<p>Time as a fundamental currency. -- A system that uses raw time as a currency rather than money. Each person has more or less the same time to live and it's fundamental.</p>

<p>--- Rich Graphical Textpiece Formatting ---</p>
<p>Big blobs of same looking text are boring and harder to reason about. So there should be a more complex graphical script that goes beyong traditional characters.</p>

<p>--- Open Credential'ing Program ---</p>
<p>A fun, dynamic and distributed service for creating and taking credential bearing tests.</p>

<p>--- Lightweight Ledgers ---</p>
<p>Lighteight (distributed) ledger technologies to rival traditional global and trustless blockchains.</p>
<p>Applicable to hosts without enough resources to accomidate a large blockchain and to many other applications.</p>
<p>They can be semi-trustless, localized (issued by a smaller cooperative) and federated, customized through forks of a lightweight reference implementation (like Lua but for crypto systems rather than programming languages), etc</p>
<p>-- A do-your-own blockchain itself would be a great project.</p>

<p>--- Distributed Development Models ---</p>
<p>A lot of code projects are centrally managed. You can fork but often times it's not especially productive to do that with a big active project like Linux (they will catch up to you anyways). There needs to be a structure that can accomidate all different groups of people working while still presenting a singular product that is usable and not completely fragmented.</p>
