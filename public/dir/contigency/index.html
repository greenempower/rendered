<h1>GEM: Contingency</h1>

<p>Here are some resources, plans and protocols for leftists in the event of unfortunate circumstances.</p>

<p>First, if you are to have your assets acquired by the US state for example, you will need to send them to somewhere that the US cannot touch.</p>

<p>Some of these states to which you can send your money to, I assume, are Cuba, Vietnam, Russia, China.</p>

<p>Specifically we are after a recipient and mode of transaction that are immune to US overeach.</p>

<p>So I shall likely have to find some crypto addresses to send to.</p>

<p>In preference to sending to foreign governments directly or indirectly, I will seek out foreign organizations to send to and if that is not preferable than we shall have a directory of individuals and their credentials which can be used to send your money to.</p>


<p>Next, the draft. In the event of a draft it shall most probably be necessary to flee. So, I shall investigate the protocol for this.</p>
