		<p>Socialism is defined as the transition state between a lower order or capitalistic society and communism. This is how Marx I believe defined in. I will note that I think anarchism is applicable in place of communism.</p>

		<p>Although it is applicable that capitalism is likely a necessary precursor to socialism just like feudalism may be a necessary precursor to capitalism.</p>

		<p>Most significantly socialism requires for the means of production to be acquired by the proletariat (or the masses) rather than being under dictatorial control of the capitalist owner class (or the Bourgeoisie).</p>

		<p>Socialism may require a large government apparatus while communism is stated as existing in the absence of the state. In theory the state apparatus of socialism should be greatly beneficial to the people as long as the masses maintain full control of it which is why I consider socialism to be inherently highly democratic.</p>

		<p>But how does socialism manifest itself technically?</p>
