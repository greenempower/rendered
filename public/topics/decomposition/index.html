<h1>Chemical Decomposition</h1>
<p>I believe that it is and will be become critically important that we can property decompose and recycle manufactured products such as electrical waste and plastics.</p>
<p>Nature has to a large degree solved the problem or recycling it's organic matter. Dead things decompose.</p>
<p>We have not fully solved this issue ourselves (at least not at a large enough scale). We need to discover and implement a chemical solution that applies to our industrial outputs and byproducts.</p>
