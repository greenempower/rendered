<h1>Brutalism is very bad culture</h1>
<p>Brutalism is not healthy. We should not just accept brutality and violence (even is it is not direct or physical) as an acceptable or normal way of life. Doing so benefits those who are powerful and best capable of doing the brutality.</p>
<p>Disrespecting the experience or wellbeing of a victim or someone who is dissadvantaged is brutalism and it is sadly common in American culture and institutions.</p>
