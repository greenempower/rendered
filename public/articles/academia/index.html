<h1>GEM Articles: Academia</h1>

<p>Academy isn't the independent liberatory place some think it is.</p>

<p>Public education doesn't serve. Rather it shapes young impressionable minds and bodies to make them docile and propagandized little worker drones that are completely incapable of thinking for themselves outside of the authority of the <strong>state capitalist complex</strong>.</p>

<p>If a young person isn't capable or willing to function this way then they are labeled and outcast. They may be called mentally challenged or given a condition such as autism or ADHD. (I can relate to this.)</p>

<p>In that case they are often brutally 'reformedâ€™ by medications or predatory 'treatment' such as ABA (Applied Behavioral Analysis) for autistics.</p>

<p>Mandatory education as a whole is for the benefit of the capitalist and for the detriment of young people.</p>

<p>What about college? Isn't college supposed to be this cool place for liberal free thinkers who just want to learn and get ahead in life? Isn't it very much different from the lower ranks of education which I described?</p>

<p>(disclaimer: I haven't formally attended UC and have only registered and visited JCs briefly.)</p>

<p>Not really. Particularly colleges offer you degrees and certifications in reward for your money and time. This service is not liberatory outside of capitalism. This behavior is not threatening to the complex. And as long as you don't use your credentials and your connections gained to truly make people's lives better or challenge the system then you are in the green.</p>

<p>The complex does not issue power to those who work against it.</p>

<p>Of course many people are OK with this. They think "I've got a degree, I'm fine, who the fuck are you and why should I care very much about others?"</p>

<p>I suspect some of those people can be drawn to our side with time and genuine effort. We need to persuade them, but we also need to build up our own institutions well enough so that they'll see our sawy and hegemony.</p>

<p>A number of these people are too far gone or may just have personalities that are unworkable for our movement and this time.</p>

<p>Academia as we know it is falling.</p>

<p>Much of academia (partularly pre-college public schooling) is failing miserably to advance past industrial-revolution capitalism style teaching.</p>

<p>Not only is schooling largely failing to catch up to modern capitalism, but the institution itself is simultaneously being disenfranchised by modern capitalist actors themselves.</p>

<p>Public schooling is so underfunded and missmanaged that in many cases children in modern society are better off not going at all. They would be better off that way then being essentially institutionalized.</p>

<p>For decades conservatives have been crucading against college and university and they're doing their part to undermine public school of course.</p>

<p>Micheal Prenti for example describes the anti-revolutionary beurachracy present in my Universities.</p>

<p>And conservatives have had great success in turning University into a club that only the wealthy and priveldged elite students can attend.</p>

<hr>

<p>Divestment.</p>

<p>I propose divestment as an appropriate strategy for myself and others, particularly the leftist community at large.</p>

<p>A high level degree should not be an indicator of positivity in our relations with our fellow comrades.</p>

<p>A high level degree shows a likely priveledge and willingness to bend the knee that we should be skeptical of in practical terms.</p>
