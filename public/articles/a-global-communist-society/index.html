<h1>GEM Articles: A Global Communist Society</h1>

<p>I talk to my family and acquantinces. They often agree with me that things are wrong that it is linked to capitalism.</p>

<p>But more than that I actually need something to sell. A full vision and roadmap moving forward.</p>

<p>First it should be understood that a truly communist society most likely requires a communist world order to realize itself fully and sustain.</p>

<p>The basis of a Communist or Anarchist society is typically a commune or some iteration of that concept.</p>

<p>A commune shall be the smallest unit of political organization and it must weild tangible political power in proportion to its membership and this power should be more or less equal to the other communes.</p>

<p>Additionally the commune most be the means through which the individual weilds their political power with equal proportion to their fellow communists and anarchists.</p>

<p>Each commune will have a maximum of ~150 members although this could be lower as peoples limits of human association are lower than that. This number tracks the upwards limit as detailed by Robert Sapolsky and other scientists who study human social relations. This limit is the maximum number of people that one person can keep meaningful relationships with themselves.</p>

<p>The commune will facilitate the political activities of it's members and potentially be the center of their interaction with the post-capitalist state. By participating with their labor and other capacities comrades can contribute to the state and recieve the fruits of their labor and the labor of other comrades.</p>

<p>Comrades may share responsibilities in maintaining and developing their jurisdictions.</p>

<p>Communes can then federate to larger groups of communes then those groups can do the same into larger groups and so on.</p>

<p>A commune system can realize the vision of absolute democracy. Whereby each individual has an equal and universally guaranteed capacity to exercize their will on society and realize it's fruits alongside their peers.</p>

<p>This system allows for comrades to exercize their will upwards and onto the post-capitalist state rather than having it the other way around.</p>
