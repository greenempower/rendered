<h1>Terry A. Davis</h1>

<p>I'm conflicted on whether or not to mark Terry as a saint or a hero. He is certainly both, although in his illness he became somewhat biggoted.</p>

<p>There is so much to learn from Terry. He was or at least tried to be a godly man and I respect that a lot. His resilience and drive were admirable.</p>
