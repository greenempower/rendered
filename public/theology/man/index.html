<h1>Man</h1>
<p>This is an idealization of what a good and virtuous man should be. You may recognize some of these tenets from religion.</p>

<p>A man refrains from passing judgement on another man when he has not already taken reasonable measures to understand the entire condition of that man. (Every man is an expert on his own condition. This understanding is not easily acquired by someone foreign.</p>

<p>A man gives more than he takes, because the godliness of a man is determined by his power in his capacity to help others.</p>

<p>A man has respect, love and understanding for life, women and his fellow man and is humble and well versed in understanding his place among them.</p>
