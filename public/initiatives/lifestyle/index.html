<p>--- A New And Modern Lifestyle ---</p>
<p>Our industrial capitalist lifestyles are unlivable. We are alienated and depressed. We are taught and rewarded for hating each other. We cannot form natural and fulfilling relationships.</p>

<p> - we have freedom of travel. there is cheap universal transportation and if a person chooses they can spend much or even most of their life in transit.</p>
<p> - our notion of 'work' is transformed. we have automation and all the basics of life are provided plus more. the necessity for any type of hard or intense labor is low and mostly irrelevant in our lives.</p>
