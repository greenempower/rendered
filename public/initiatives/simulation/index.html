<h1>GEM Initiatives: Simulation</h1>

<p>At this time I have a few physical work engineering projects in the works and they have been that way for years.</p>

<p>I have ideas and plans for fun electronic toys and an electronic control system for 3D printers to name a few.</p>

<p>I'd say my biggest opstical to producing these things is cost.</p>

<p>Development new products is expensive. The cost of designing, prototyping and developing a new product yourself is far more expensive than the end product once it becomes commodity.</p>

<p>Each prototype you produce is costly, but even more so the lab infrastructure typically required to do this is an immense burden. Normal individuals cannot sustain that alone.</p>

<p>The overall cost of development of a product goes down as you jam more and more of your process onto digital systems.</p>

<p>There needs to be a digital system with which you can do this.</p>

<p>Chiefly the system needs to be capable of understanding detialed physical and electrical models so that it can adequately simulate and render them, much like you would do otherwise by creating a prototype.</p>

<p>This is what our initiative desires and it shall be fulfilled through a software system within GEMX.</p>
