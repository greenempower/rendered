<h1>GEM Draft GEMX: Universal GEM</h1>

<p>A universal gem is a file with one of the extensions:</p>
<p> - .gem : standard although incompatible with ruby gem's</p>
<p> - .gema : archive or atomic / self contained blob</p>
<p> - .ugem : standard compatibility</p>
<p> - .ygem</p>
<p> - .xgem : extensible or extended, something like that</p>
<p> - .gemx : system notation</p>
<p> - .gems : gem script</p>
<p> - .gemb : unspecified binary image</p>

<p>Although a single file notation such as .ugem is probably preferable.</p>

<p>Universal GEMs are based on XML and can encode data under a great number of external formats.</p>

<h2>GEM Script</h2>
	<p>gem script will be a lightweight meta programming language for general purpose use among the broader ugem and gemx systems</p>
	<p>gems will provide modern and safe methods for accessing system resources through bytecode representation and provide faculties for accessing hardware interfaces directly</p>
	<p>gems is not intended for use on systems where a gemx installation is not present</p>
	<p>there may be a compiler for gems for embedded applications where a full gemx installation is not available. the compiler will optimize and bake what is only necessary into the produced binary. it may be the case that designing a seperate embedded language or just using C is preferable to designing and maintaining this compiler</p>
	<p>gems is intended to be written within env:dev</p>


	<p>-------</p>
	<p>ugem will be highly dynamic but also conscious of the basic low level structure of modern computing systems. So the language will not be structured in any way that is contrary to fundamental apsects or limitations of hardware so to be basically efficient unlike languages such as Python or even Java.</p>
	<p>A good example of this concept in other languages in well expressed in Lua and somewhat in Javascript although JS requires a much more complex VM and JIT compiler than Lua does.</p>
	<p>Lua can be compiled with low overhead to x86 or to other architectures via LLVM to produce very speedy code comparable to the performance of a C program performing the same functions.</p>
