		<h1>GEM Draft: The GEMX subsystem for Linux</h1>

		<p>GEMX is our software subsystem for Linux.</p>

		<p>GEMX installs itself under /opt/gemx/ and tries to emulate a full system sitting upon the Linux kernel among other things.</p>

		<p>The purpose of GEMX is to house and well integrate our wide spectrum of software, services and initiatives in a unified container.</p>

		<p>It is generally outside of scope to completely reimplement technologies where there is already a largely viable solution.</p>
		
		<p>GEMX will be a vesicle for fulfilling our degoogle initiative. Escentially we can aim to provide the same or better services to our comrades (general large and small scale entities and individuals) that google does provide or fails at doing so adequately. We will do this with a practical approach leveraging modern decentralized technologies.</p>

		<p>GEMX will be deeply based and incorporated by a set of new technologies and technical philosophies. Additionally GEMX will be designed with some eye for future development. I will anticipate the technologies that GEM is development and may probably become increasingly relevent with time.</p>

		<p>Computers are becoming faster even with the slow down of moores law. Eventually we will move to new technologies such as carbon and allow computing that will revolutionize computing in terms of speed, efficience/power consumption, memory capacity and speed, form factor, etc...</p>

		<p>Extraneous technologies will have a major impact too. Before long we will have carbon batteries that are safer/longer lasting, lighter and will have great capacity improvements.</p>

		<p>Networking will become increasingly sophisticated as the networks themselves advance in terms of speed and complexity and the devices that leverage them are revolutionized.</p>

		<p>Centralized networking models will become less necessary and less desirable. In their place new decentralized mesh models will emerge that are highly secure, rebost, autonoumous and censorship/surveilence resitant.</p>

		<p>Computer software will sophisticate and become more intelligent as computer science further matures along with intelligent multi-fascited fields such as machine learning.</p>

		<p>The development of GEMX should be accompanied with the development of new hardware. Development will neccessarily be accompanied with the research and consideration of existing, new and anticipated hardware.</p>

		<p>GEMX will be highly internationalized. It will support as many languages as possible and provide tools such as translation and currency conversions.</p>

		<p>GEMX will incorporate a system for dealing with decentralized cryptographic blockchain technologies such as Ethereum. It will include code for doing things such as starting and managing DAOs.</p>


		<h2><a href="Systems"</h2>
			<ul>
				<a href="./systems/data">data</a>
				<a href="./systems/browser">browser</a>
				<a href="./systems/simulation">simulation</a>
			</ul>

		<h2>Installation</h2>
			<p>The repo comes with a script named installer.py

		<h2>Bundled Application Frameworks</h2>
			<p>GEMX will integrate a networked search and discovery system. Maybe initially integrating projects like searx and protocols such as RSS.</p>
			<p>GEMX will integrate a sophisticated and highly secure networked messaging and mailing system.</p>
			<p>GEMX will integrate a relational system for transalting data and working with structured data in regards to it's relation to other data. Among other things the system will provide a wide sit of converters to convert files and other data to and from differing formats.</p>
			<p>GEMX will integrate an relational entropy system. All data processed by GEMX will be passed through this system and it will compress it and keep meta-state.</p>
			<p>GEMX will integrate a general code engine. The code engine will be accompanied by a new meta-programming language. The code engine will incorporate existing technologies such as clang and do new things entirely. The code engine will be capable of analysing code of all different forms.</p>
			<p>GEMX will integrate a framework for creating and manipulating general multimedia.</p>
			<p>GEMX will integrate the ffmpeg API and use it to provide practical means for which to manipulate media.</p>
			<p>GEMX will integrate a system for doing simulation and CAD work.</p>
			<p>GEMX will integrate the Tor network.</p>
			<p>GEMX will integrate a general intel system. This system will help users develop their knowledge and intelligence. It will aid in studying and promoting intellectual fulfillment at an accelerated pace.</p>


		<p>The core of GEMX will run via a daemon.</p>
		<p>GEMX will include a web browsing application based on Firefox.</p>
		<p>GEMX core and applications will be configured and interfaced through the web browser. The daemon will run a web server and be exposed through a host named 'gemx'.</p>


		<p>Additionally there will be a number of services which are intended for integration; GitLab, Open Collective, LBRY/Odysee</p>

		<h2>Interaction</h2>

		<h2>Data and Compression</h2>
			<p>All data in GEMX will be stored and compressed in a large database.</p>
			<p>GEMX will constantly take into account entropy. All data, code and highler level protocol will be optimally compressed.</p>
			<p>Each file and piece of data will be compressed in a database of objects.</p>
			<p>There will be a sort of large entropy file. The data system will take in data and compress it. While it does this it will analyze it in the context of data it's recieved to form an entropy file that acts as metadata for the compression of all objects.</p>


			<h3>Integrated Standards and Technologies</h3>

		<h2>Working Draft</h2>
			<p>Possibly there should be an intelligent patching system. I would like to regularly fork/modify software projects and have a system that can intelligently deal with version conflicts.</p>
