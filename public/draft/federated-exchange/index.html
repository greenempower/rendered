<h1>Undisclosed Federated Exchange Network</h1>
<p>The name of this project is undiclosed as I have not bought the domain yet. It will be refered to as 'Undisclosed Federated Exchange Network'.</p>

<p>Initially the exchange site will be used as our own personal redistribution shop. Our shop will be located at gem.domain.com and there will be a solution for other peoples to host their own domains if they prefer.</p>

<p>Our exchange will redistribute many goods that pertain to our operation or may be useful as commodities and industrial inputs. Most of the goods will be ordered from China through Alibaba/Aliexpress initially. I do have some intention to import goods from manufacturing countries such as Japan and Germany.</p>

<p>Our exchange will compete with Amazon and we will have to consier two things: how are we going to do better? and how are we going to survive attacks from Amazon as they realize we are a threat.</p>

<p>We must treat our workers/federation members well. The federation will be run from the top down and the individual markets organize themselves while sending orders upwards democratically.</p>

<p>It should be assumed that attacks coming from Amazon and other political monopolies will be relatively predicatable if we study theory and look towards history. So it will be necessary that we do both of those things and consider everything the existing powers could do as if they are inevitable.</p>

<p>Some of the services we may provide to our members of a system of trust and identity. We can help protect buyers and sellers from fraud. We may also produce software and services that aid in administering their markets and shops.</p>

<p>Items in review</p>

<p>We may redistribute the LCD screen replacement for the Moto G7 Power as it costs half as much from Aliexpress. I have ordered two LCD units from two different sources. <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32964175397.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.7e484c4d4RMKDS">KingCrop</a> and <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001250525715.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.7e484c4d4RMKDS">YiYu</a></p>

<p>KingCrop worked but the cable link was week.</p>
<p>YiYu I have not tested yet.</p>

<p>I have ordered two sets of ear buds which are waiting to be arrived. <a href=https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002277907649.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.3da24c4dhJ8qYl">Qi-xing</a> and <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002352679152.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.3da24c4dhJ8qYl">Global Economic Digital Store</a></p>

<p>Both sets significantly cheaper than local alternatives.</p>

<p>We can also distribute specialty clothing and cosplay, mainly leftist uniforms and stuff. Also functional wear such as outdoors stuff and other things such as electronic integrated wear.</p>

<p>We may resdistribute <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32999923492.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.362a5c0fCnnIAq&algo_pvid=c8cb4882-e598-4582-9553-4e7fcef352ca&algo_exp_id=c8cb4882-e598-4582-9553-4e7fcef352ca-3">SMD RGB Leds</a>.</p>
