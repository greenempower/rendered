<h1>Undisclosed Mesh Project</h1>
<p>The name of this project and other projects is currently undisclosed as I have not yet bought the domain. Currently it shall be refered to as 'Undisclosed Mesh Project'.</p>

<h1>Technologies</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Mesh Networking</li>
    <li>Decentralized Identities</li>
</ul>

<h1>Issues</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Performance</li>
    <li>Referencing of raw data (ex. referencing of parts of youtube videos in a streamlined and convenient way with comments and metadata.</li>
    <li>News and centralized and personalized content delivery and notifications.</li>
    <li>Algorithms as a commodity.</li>
    <li>Computer Design.</li>
    <li>Search Algorithms.</li>
    <li>Content Management.</li>
    <li>Avoiding repetitions and redundancy at a personal and global level.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Manifestations</h1>
	<p>A manifestation of this work will be a intellectual assistant. The assistant will be capable of analyzing thousands of books concurrently and in relation to one another to form a complex web of understanding.</p>
	<p>The intellectual assistant can aid you in your knowledge and research. It can essentially read any book for you and tell you what you need to know based on contextual user inputs.</p>

	<p>A manifestation of this work will be a general purpose compression algorithm. The algorithm will be best applied to large sets of non-random data. The compression algorithm will be AI/ML like in that they will be trained using large sets of data themselves. The compression algorithm will produce an entropy file alonside the essence of the input data.</p>
