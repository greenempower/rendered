--- New Compute System --- 
A new, broad and versitile CPU standard for general high performance usage.

Fabricating chips on a modern node 28nm-5nm is expensive. Capitalists hegemony has us here as there is not a democratically run enterprise capable of manufacturing on these nodes.

So this should be an initiative to bring together peoples and crowd funding to form a co-op purely for designing and manufacturing these new silicon products for use in our new hegemony.

The chips should be designed with sustainability, longevity and versatility in mind. Essentially optimising for power usage and general purpose programmability.

The silicon should be designed to merge the functionality of parallel graphics silicon and traditional monolithic cores, see Fujitsu A64FX.

The processor may also have the capacity to execute an extended bytecode if this does not create too large a burden.

- Maybe it should integrate an FPGA, idk might just want to do that seperately.


The silicon should use a chiplet like design.

The ICs must be applicable for use in very small embedded designs and SBCs.

The ICs must be applicable to clusters.
