<h1>Green Empower System</h1>

<p>We shall define a new operating system with accompanying physical systems.</p>

<p>There shall be a new programming language and digital representation system framework.</p>

<p>I am determining the target hardware... The system may be highly agnostic of hardware.</p>

<h2>Digital Manipulation Framework</h2>
	<p>Work can begin on this on existing Linux systems.</p>
	<p>I may start with XML and adapt it into a general purpose programming system.</p>
	<p>The system will be accompanied by various operating kernels...</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
	<p>First there shall be a gem subsystem. (gemx)</p>
	<p>The subsystem will essentially act to create a blanket over the host system.</p>
	<p>The subsystem will install our code and libraries onto the system.</p>
	<p>Intially the subsystem will sit atop Linux based systems.</p>

<p>The system will greately employ virtualization, emulation and code translation.</p>

<p>GemSys shall be a scientific system. We shall facilitate simulation and commodity algorithms.</p>

<p>Our goal shall be to keep a large scale of code interoperability through rich metadata among other things.</p>


<h2>GEMX</h2>
	<p>This is the subsystem.</p>
