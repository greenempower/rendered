<h1>GEM: War</h1>

<p>Globally we are in a constant state of war.</p>

<p>Within the US we have the class war which is being waged even though many Americans are unaware of it.</p>

<p>Globally we have the new cold war. Major powers are militarizing and competing in the power space.</p>

<p>In the new cold war the two major players are essentially the USA and China. Most everyone else is probably aligned with one or the other.</p>

<p>Of course then there are greater internation organizations such as the European Union and the United Nations. This is an area of further learning for me.</p>

<p>As far as I'm concerned the new cold war is bogus. Both countries are further militarizing (China plans to reach parody with the US military in ~20 years.) and we can't have that.</p>

<p>This war will do nothing to improve our lives and I will assume that the USA is the primary instigator here as usual.</p>

<p>Globally we should seek demilitarization and cooperation. The more so we can achieve the better off we as the people of this earth will be.</p>
