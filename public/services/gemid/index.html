<h1>Identity Accounting System of The Green Empower Organization; Green Empower ID (GEMID)</h1>
<p>Green Empower will administer an ID for individuals and entities and it will be titled GEMID.</p>

<p>GEMID will simply act as an accounting system accross our services with the aim of creation a unique ID for each identity of a person or other organizational body.</p>

<p>I shall aim that we mostly don't need to use this system in the operation of our services as I see it as possibly infringing upon the freedom and anonymity of peoples.</p>
