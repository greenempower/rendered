<h1>GEM: Analysis of Education</h1>

<p>I would like to do a large scale analysis of the state of education and higher education in America and abroad.</p>

<p>It seems that the entire education system is corrupted to serve the interest of capital.</p>

<p>The primary education system is a factory for conditioning children.</p>
