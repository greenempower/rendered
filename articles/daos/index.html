<h2>State of Wyoming's DAO Program</h2>
	<p>The state of Wyomin (USA) has recently started a program in which you can form/register a DAO with them for a fee of $100 and $60+ for every year afterwards.</p>
	<p><a href="https://sos.wyo.gov/Business/Docs/DAOs_FAQs.pdf">FAQ</a></p>
	<p>I'm a little bit suspicious. Wyoming is a right wing state, but so is every other American state. So I am more concerned about the security of the DAO and what control Wyoming maintains over it.</p>
	<p>Can it operate independently of the state? Does the state maintain any propriety over the organization (ex. do they have your keys?).</p>
