		<h2>Planning</h2>
        <hr class="t2">
            <p>Green Empower will eventually incorporate as a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) on the ethereum network as soon as prices are made reasonable and affordable.</p>
            <p>Green Empower will eventually issue it's own cryptocurrency. The coin will be administered and regulated by our organization. In a sense we may act as a government here. We may tax or otherwise validate the transactions on our network. Individuals activists and investors may buy our coin with the knowledge that they are helping to fund our org and in exchange and as a result they may see it's value increase with time. - see the FEC's lawsuit against LBRY.</p>
            <p>We will buy a property. Maybe a few acres in rural California.</p>
            <p>We however might need to do some filing. I am unsure of which locality to do that under and when.</p>
