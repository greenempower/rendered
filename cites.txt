"TWO WOLVES"

I recently came across this jewel in a book I read, and now share it with YOU:

One evening, an old Cherokee told his grandson about a battle that goes on inside of people.

He said, "My son, the battle is between two wolves inside us all.

"One is EVIL - It is anger, envy, jealousy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego.

"One is GOOD - It is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith."

The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather: "Which wolf wins?"

The old Cherokee simply replied: "THE ONE YOU FEED."

"""Lmao, i becomed a commie by browsing this sub.

At first I was just trying to understand why do people like the communist ideology, since from my liberal perspective back then, it didn't made any sense, and i saw it just as equal to fascism, and anything that was against the western narrative was definitely bad.

From this subreddit i learned about how much flavour and complexity is in our world and how actions need a lot of context to be understandable, this stuff radicalized me into a Marxist-Leninist.

Materialism is like reading, after you start learning about it, you can't just stop using it to see the world.""" - u/TanyaDaTankie
