		<h1>The GEM License</h1>
		<p>The GEM is a leftist license that adheres to the philosophy of The Green Empower Organization.</p>

		<p>This license works to facilitate the transition from Capitalism to Socialism and then from Socialism to a higher order society in which we are all prosperous, engaged and self-determinant.</p>

		<p>This license will adapt based on the government of which it is being subject to. This is necessary as not all societies are equal in their political development.</p>

		<p>It is expected that this license is treated with respect by all who interact with it.</p>
