<h1>Human Nature</h1>

<p>Here will be a description on human nature from our perspective and we will specify how it plays into our politics and how it is misrepresented by the right for their political aims.</p>

<p>I will reference the book "Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst‚Äù by Robert M. Sapolsky a lot and I will also reference his lectures.</p>

<p>I've noticed that right wingers love to bring up human nature when arguing that communism is bad or doesn't work.</p>

<p>If you see right wing propaganda you see that 'human nature' is always critical in arguing that we can't have nice things.</p>

<p>I propose that the right wing's description of human nature is necessarily degenerative.</p>

<p>As capitalism relies on the stupidity and division of the working class, their myth of human nature fits that very well.</p>

<p>Why can communism never work? Because human nature is degenerative and normal people aren't capable of organizing and governing themselves.</p>

<p>The conservative notion of human nature is brutalistic, selfish, greedy and short sided.</p>
