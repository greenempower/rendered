<h1>College Worship</h1>
<p>Liberals and progressives in America seem to generally have a weird idolization of college.</p>
<p>I don't think it's wrong others to go to college or have the right to go to college without going into debt or paying sever tens of thousands of dollars to do so.</p>
<p>My issue with the notion that everyone should go to college as, for example, Nina Turner proposed during her appearance on the Bad Faith podcast.</p>
<p>This is wrong and dismissive of the desires, temperment and inclinations of millions of Americans. It's the wrong road to go down is not productive.</p>
<p>It is also ignorant of technology and the potential for education taking place in a much more personalized and freer way than traditional industrialized and manditory education, which is curently failing so many young people.</p>
