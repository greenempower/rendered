<h1>Applied Behavioral Analysis</h1>

<p>ABA is a 'therapy' meanly used in 'treating' autism.</p>

<p>In practice it tends to be highly abusive and degrading to the recipient.</p>

<p>I was diagnosed with ASD when I was 15. Shortly afterwards I was enrolled in an ABA clinit in my town.</p>

<p>The place was alright superficially.</p>

<p>The owner of the place was very rude to me and tried to put me down.</p>

<p>It became clear that this therapy was about degradation, submission and training.</p>

<p>It was sorta dehumanizing so I created a scene and accosted some therapists until they couldn't handle me anymore.</p>
