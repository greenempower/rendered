		<h1>Description of Financial Affairs</h1>
			<p>Intially and currently Green Empower exists as an extension of myself and it is funded by my personal capital.</p>

			<p>As soon as our organization recieves meaninfull donations then that will likely become our primary mode of income.</p>

			<p>I am open to persons who want to help me develop this organization as equal partners.</p>

			<p>At some point I would desire to establish a method of capital accumulation that is inependent of sustained donations and that will likely be predicated on our existing capital being well developed.</p>
